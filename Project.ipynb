    "## 2. Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Covert communication is method of exchanging secret messages in which the communication is hidden. A related term is steganography which  deals with methods  to write/embed hidden messages in such a way that no one, other than the sender and the intended receiver, know the existence of the message. The word steganography is of Greek origin and means \"concealed writing\" from the Greek words steganos meaning \"covered or protected\", and graphei meaning \"writing\" [From Wikipedia]. Steganography and covert channels have a long history and was used  in WWII to send secret messages to spies behind enemy lines. In the computer and network security, covert channels and steganography  fall in the broad category of security through obscurity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of a covert channel over cryptography is that messages do not attract attention to themselves. Plainly visible encrypted messages — no matter how unbreakable — will arouse suspicion. The very presence of encrypted messages may be incriminating in countries where encryption is illegal. In such cases the communication channel must itself be hidden and this is achieved using covert channels / steganography. Note that, cryptography protects the contents of a message. Covert communication on the other hand protects both the message and the communicating parties.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, steganography refers to the concealment of information within a document file, image file, or program. Media files are ideal for steganographic transmission because of their large size. As a simple example, a sender might start with an innocuous image file and adjust the color of every 100th pixel to correspond to a letter in the alphabet. The overall change is so small  that someone not specifically looking for it is unlikely to notice it. Another method is called the Least Significant Bit (LSB) substitution. In this method, the least significant bit of each  pixel in a digital image is modified by the bits  of the secret message. Since the LSB contributes very little to the overall (intensity/color/brightness) of each pixel, the change in the image will be imperceptible to the naked eye.\n",
    "\n",
    "Covert channels are communication channels that are established over some overt medium. For example, we can uses a stream of network packets (for example stream of packets generated by a Skype call) as the overt carrier for a covert communication channel. As usual, we have our three characters Alice, Bob, and Eve. Alice and Bob are in a repressive country where all communication is monitored and they want to establish a covert channel to exchange secret messages. Eve is a warden who can look at all network packets and try to detect if any covert communication is being used to plan a uprising against the repressive state.\n",
    "\n",
    "To setup a covert communication channel, Alice and Bob first initiate an overt application let say a (computer to computer) Skype call and they start a regular innocuous conversation. Their interactive conversation produces a stream of IP packets from Alice to Bob and Bob to Alice.  For the time being let us only consider covert channel in one direction from Alice to Bob and hence only consider the IP packets stream from Alice to Bob. There are two ways in which Alice can send a secret message. She can replace some unused bits in the protocol header with the bits of the covert message. This is called a **covert storage channel**. These types of channels are easily detectable since the protocol header fields that are not used are well known to Eve and she can check bits to detect the covert channel, identify Alice and Bob and the covert message. The other method that Alice can uses is to alter the inter-packet delays of the IP packet using a pre-established shared key to modulate the bits of the secret message. This is called a **covert timing channel** and will be the focus of our study.  \n",

    "To make things more concrete lets consider a concrete example. For simplicity, we will assume that Alice has buffered a large number of the IP packets that she has generated (as a result of her talking). This is obviously not realistic [why?] but for this first step let's make this assumption. Each packet has two attributes 1) a sequence number and 2) the time when the packet was generated. Thus, P(n, tn) denotes packet n which was generated at time tn. We will assume that the first packet is numbered 1 and is generated at  time 0, i.e.,  t1 = 0. Note that the time field gives the cumulative time. To obtain the inter-packet delay, we can take the time difference between the consecutive packets.  This packet stream is the unmodified overt traffic.\n",
    "Alice and Bob have a priori decided that an inter-packet delay of 0.5 will  be used to code 1 and an inter-packet delay of 0.1 will be used to code a 0. So if Alice wants to send the alphabet “b” (which isd 0110 0010) she will generate the following sequence of packets P(1, T0), P(2, T1=T0+0.1), P(3, T2=T1+0.5), P(3, T3 = T2+0.1), P(4, T4 = T3+0.1) for the first 4 bits starting from the LSB.  This  is shown in the Figure below. \n",

    "If the timing between the packets are not altered by the network or by Eve, then Bob can observe  the inter-packet delays, translate them to binary  bits and then determine the corresponding character.  In this assignment, we will try to design a method of modulating the bits into inter-packet delays such that Eve is not able to discover the channel. We will assume that the network or Eve will not modify the inter-packet delays."

    "Alice ad Bob are having a Skype call. When Alice talks, the Skype application generates packets. This is called the **overt packet stream**. In her computer Alice has created a packet buffer (in memory)  which holds a bunch of packets (as many as required to send the secret message) and then a using aspecially designed packet scheduler releases the packet with interpacket delays that encode the secret message.  The overall system in Alice's computer is shown in the Figure below.  In this part of the project we  will consider a few simple scheme for encoding a secret message in the inter-packet delays. \n",
